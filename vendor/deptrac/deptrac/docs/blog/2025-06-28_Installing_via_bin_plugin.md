# Installing Deptrac using `bamarni/composer-bin-plugin`

Jun 28, 2025 - 3 min read

Have you tried installing Deptrac as a `composer --dev` dependency and
encountered Composer conflicts? This blog post is for you! We will show you how
to install Deptrac as a Composer dependency in a separate scoped installation
that will not conflict with any of your existing Composer dependencies.

---

Deptrac as a library itself has its own dependencies as many PHP packages do. This may become a problem if the dependencies of Deptrac are not compatible with already existing dependencies in your project. Most notably, Deptrac depends on a number of `symfony` packages.

Imagine a situation where you depend on newer major version of `symfony/console` than Deptrac does. For example your `composer.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/console": "^7.0"
    }
}
```

If you try to install the newest version of Deptrac at the time of writing
(`4.0.x-dev`), Composer won't let you:

```console
$ composer require --dev deptrac/deptrac:4.0.x-dev -W
./composer.json has been updated
Running composer update deptrac/deptrac --with-all-dependencies
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires deptrac/deptrac 4.0.x-dev -> satisfiable by deptrac/deptrac[4.0.x-dev].
    - deptrac/deptrac 4.0.x-dev requires symfony/console ^6.0 -> found symfony/console[v6.0.0, ..., v6.4.23] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (^7.0).


Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
```

Luckily, there is a solution for this exact problem of conflicting dev
dependencies. It comes in the form of the [bamarni/composer-bin-plugin](https://github.com/bamarni/composer-bin-plugin). First, let's install the plugin:

```console
$ composer require --dev bamarni/composer-bin-plugin
./composer.json has been updated
Running composer update bamarni/composer-bin-plugin
Loading composer repositories with package information

bamarni/composer-bin-plugin contains a Composer plugin which is currently not in your allow-plugins config. See https://getcomposer.org/allow-plugins
Do you trust "bamarni/composer-bin-plugin" to execute code and wish to enable it now? (writes "allow-plugins" to composer.json) [y,n,d,?] y

Now you can install a scoped version of Deptrac in the `deptrac` namespace:

```console
$ composer bin deptrac require --dev deptrac/deptrac:4.0.x-dev -W

Your Deptrac executable is now in
`vendor-bin/deptrac/vendor/deptrac/deptrac/deptrac`. To make calling it easier,
you might want to create a Composer alias for it in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deptrac": "vendor-bin/deptrac/vendor/deptrac/deptrac/deptrac -c deptrac.php --report-uncovered"
  }
}
```

You can now call `composer deptrac` to run Deptrac itself.
